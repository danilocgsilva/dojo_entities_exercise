# Dojo for MVC exercises

Uncle Bob mentions in his book, the Clean Coder, about a way to practice common tasks in the programming world: a *Dojo*.

Time by time, you may redo some simple exercises to refine your abilities.

If he told, then it makes sense!

I would like to propose a little longer one. That can be practiced through several MVC frameworks. What about practice models relationship and several others common tasks in the usual MVC work?

A system that will provides full functionality to the following:

* User registering
* User login
* Housing registering
* Relationships between housings and persons
* Full CRUD over persons and housings
* API to allow third parties to allow crud

Personaly, I will handle this exercises to my three main MVC frameworks:

* Laravel
* Symphony
* .NET
