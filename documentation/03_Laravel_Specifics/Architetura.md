# Laravel Architeture Documentation

Uses the most recent Laravel version (6.5.2 at the time of the writing). But as said in the [Architectural Documentation](../02_Architectural/index.md), the bootstrap framework will be set to 3.7.x, which is not the default from the most recent Laravel version.

We can use a local virtual host to deploy, or even to develop the application.

In the development and deployiment machine (for this project, it makes sense to have the same environment for development and production), set a virtual host with address: `laravel.dojo`.
