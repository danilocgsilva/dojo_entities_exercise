# Documentation types

The technical documentation can be classified by five kinds:

## 1. Requirements

In sort, the documentation that tells the software features. It os not exactly techinical. Very friendly for manager, but important for programers that will drive further development.

## 2. Architectural

Tells how the features from the technical documentation shoud be done in technical terms. Still does not mentions frameworks or any specific tool, but already enters in the technical domain.

IMPORTANT NOTE:The Architectural documentation may also document specifc tools, since this tool do not vary between possibilities for framework chose. In the web project, the backend framework may vary much, but frontend tools may not. So, in the case of frontend tools, this may be approached by the Architectural Documentation.

## 3. Design

Enters in the tools domains. Extends the architetural documentation telling how to do inside some specific tool or framework.

## 4. DDD (Document Design Database)

MER documentation.

## 5. API Documentation

The description method by method from the code. Shoud be automatically generated by some tool that will read the docblocks from the code and generates the documentation.
